This game was made in 2 days for the Creajeux jam. The theme was “Deeper and deeper”. Our team chose to focus on psychological depth, and therefore on trauma.

Unfortunately, it wasn't finished the way we wanted, as we were 2 developers and did the assets ourselves. Nonetheless, we did have the opportunity to create a few cool systems, such as object gripping and rotation, and interactions.
